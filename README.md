# Microservices with Spring

This project accompanies the Microservices & Monoliths section in CodingNomads' Advanced Java & Spring Development Course.

It consists of a Eureka management server, three independant microservice projects, and a 
client application that presents a front-end using data aggregated from each of the microservices.
